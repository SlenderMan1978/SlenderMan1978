## Hi there! ❤️❤️

**Above is my favorite galgame, *Witch on the Holy Night*. Hopefully, you can also enjoy it.**

Nice to meet you guys. 😊😊

There is nothing that makes me happier than becoming a member of GitHub. As a newbie in programming, I hope everyone can be understanding and forgiving of the mistakes I make in programming. I will work hard to improve myself .The next time I update this homepage, I will be a pupil in programming.😏
